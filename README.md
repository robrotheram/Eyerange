========

EyeRange was a demo application that was written in a 2 day hackathon. The brief was to come up with an application and a business idea around the iBeacon technology. Our idea was about golf, As the user gets up to the start of a hole the app using iBeacons would detect the hole and give users info about the hole. There were also other features that allows users to rank themselves against other appointments.
